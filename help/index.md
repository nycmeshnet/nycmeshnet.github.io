title: "Volunteer and Help!"

Growth and maintaining the network couldn't be possible without the network of volunteers dedicating countless hours. You can help us scale too. Check out the brief descriptions below and join the appropriate [Slack channels](https://slack.nycmesh.net). Our teams are super autonomous and 100% self motivated. If you have an idea, contribute and be ready to make it happen.

***
**Grants, Corporate Sponsorships [#Funding](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/funding)**
It ain't cheap and we need $$ to expand. 

***

**Install Team**
This involves climbing on roofs, drilling holes, running ethernet cable, crimping cable, antenna alignment, antenna channel selection. 

Install coordinator: Inventory control, coordinating install teams, identifying viable installs, streamlining installs, working with contractors.

Install team leader: Person experienced with drilling concrete and window frames, to lead rooftop installs. Laptop configuring of routers and Ethernet crimping skills are good too. Volunteers can also come along to installs to learn these skills.

Install planner: We have hundreds of node applications. See if you can join the rooftops together on our [map](https://nycmesh.net/map/) and plan an install. This takes lots of emailing and phone calls.

**Neighborhood Organizers and Internet Gateways [#neighborhoods](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/neighborhoods)**
For sharing all neighborhood specific information.  

Internet gateway: Did you set up a node on your rooftop? Share it here to connect with your neighbors! Chances are high that someone across the street is looking to pair up.  

Organizers: Distribute leaflets and help organize events in your neighborhood. Get your local community centers involved. Educate your neighbors and local businesses about the network.

**Donate Space [#hq](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/hq)**
We need a space to store equipment (cables and antennas), prepare installs, and host a monthly MeetUp.
