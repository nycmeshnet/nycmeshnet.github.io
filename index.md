### [Join](/join) our community-owned network to replace your current internet connection.

Our network consists of Wi-Fi router "nodes", "supernodes" and fiber spread throughout the city. The network connects directly to the internet backbone, so we do not rely on an ISP. All of our network nodes cooperate in the distribution of data, and the network can also function independently in case of emergencies or internet shutdown.

NYC Mesh is a neutral network that does not block or discriminate content. NYC Mesh does not collect, store, monitor, or log any user traffic or content that passes through our network.

We can connect whole buildings by wireless for speeds between 80 Mbps up to 1 Gbps, or by fiber at 20 Gbps (20,000 Mbps). The buildings we are currently planning include co-ops, a school and housing association buildings. Fiber involves an install fee and a monthly rental. For a quote, [email us](mailto:install@nycmesh.net).

If you're a network operator, please consider peering with our open network to provide bandwidth! (<a href="/peering">Our peering policy</a>)

<h2>Our mission</h2>

We aim to create an open, resilient, neutral network that serves both for daily internet use, and for emergency use during power outages or internet disruption, running software that helps our community.
