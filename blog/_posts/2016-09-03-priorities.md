Here is a list of my current priorities for the mesh in order of importance. I'll keep this updated. If you are wondering why obvious things are missing, it is because they are not a priority to me! Other mesh people have different priorities.

**Tall structure installs**

Tall structures are the only way we can expand the wireless mesh. This is by far our biggest priority. There are a few different types in the city and we need to try them all- NYCHA buildings, skyscrapers, churches, schools, libraries, existing antenna masts and building coops. We need specific letters and handouts for each of these types of structures. We are currently approaching libraries and [churches](../../leaflet/church.pdf). We need to build presentations for coop boards and others.  

Once we have a tall structure in a neighborhood we can link to apartment building rooftops.

**Supernode**

The supernode at 375 Pearl St. will be our first install on a tall structure. Here is our todo list-

Edit and sign the contract  
Pay for COI  
Run the ethernet cables to the platform  
Install and test P2P and sector P2M antennas   
Install BGP servers in rack   
Turn it on

**Cheap indoor router**

TP-Link locked down its 5GHz routers so we no longer have dual-band support. The 842ND is discontinued and the 841 has poor OpenWrt support. LinkSys seems an obvious choice. We are currently compiling new firmware so we can start adding support for more routers. Suggestions of cheap, off the shelf hardware are welcome.

**Collaborations**

We are just starting some exciting collaborations with Zoetic Networks and Brooklyn Microgrid. This is essential to our growth and we should have more of this. 

**Monitoring**

We are currently switching from Nagios to Incinga2. Icinga2 is basically a new fork of Nagios and is compatible with it. Monitoring, alerts and maintainance are hugely important. If a single node goes down it can email us automatically in a way that we can get things running quickly again.

**Donations**

The supernode has a monthly rental and we need to get monthly donations to cover this. So far we have over $4000 donated, mostly from a few generous people, which will cover most of the install. You can donate via our [donate page](../../donate)

**Meetup space**

DBA bar has been good for social meetups but there are many people who cannot or don't want to meet in bars. We need a regular space for social meetups and also a regular space for hardware and software hack type meetups.
