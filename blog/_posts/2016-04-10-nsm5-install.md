NanoStation NSM5 installs 



**Hardware**

The simplest install is to use an existing vertical pipe and the two plastic ties that are included with the router. Also a thick PVC pipe can be attached to a railing using clamps.

If you need to aim the router up or down you can use a [nanobracket](https://www.streakwave.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=NBU001).

The [Ubiquiti window/wall mount](http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-NanoStation-Window-Mount/dp/B004EHUR8U) is a versatile mount that comes with a suction cup for windows or a screw mount for walls. The parts are reversible so the NSM5 can face either way and it also has vertical and horizontal adjustment to point in almost any direction.

The [Ubiquiti universal antenna mount](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J1WSGI/) can be used on rooftops or walls, where a very strong mount is needed.

**Windows**

Outside:  
On the outside of the window it is best to use a Ubiquiti wall/window mount.

Inside:  
It is often more convenient to install inside the window. You will lose about 2db of signal but that is usually ok.

Velcro is the easiest way to install a NanoStation if it will be facing the same direction as the window.

A Ubiquiti suction cup mount can be used if you need to point the router at an angle.

**Rooftops**

Often rooftops have an existing unused pipe or abandoned antenna pole that can be used.

A Ubiquiti bracket is good if you have a drillable surface such as brick or cement.

**Wall**

A simple wall mount can be made using a small, thin piece of wood and the two plastic ties that come with the router. This will not give you much choice in direction.

The Ubiquiti window/wall mount comes with both a suction cup for windows and a screw mount for walls. Use this screw mount on a wall so you can point the router in the best direction.

**Tree**

Sometimes a tree is the best place.
